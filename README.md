# Quality-of---red-wine
I did a same task in both regression and classification model but in both models i have used same KNN algorithm.<br>
In regression model,accuracy score is 62%.<br>
We know that,our target value is quality and their values ranges from 0-10.<br>
In Classification model,I have separated the quality range into two parts,
  <li>Good quality:7-10</li>
  <li>Bad quality:0-6</li>
 <br>
(i.e) whenever output is greater than 6 then it comes under good quality else it comes under bad quality.<br>
Accuracy score of classification model is 88%.<br>
So,Classification model gives better accuracy than Regression model.
